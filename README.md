# GoDaYoda ðŸŽ­

A fun CLI application that fetches random quotes and transforms them with different personalities using Ollama LLM.

## Features

- Fetches random quotes from dummyjson.com
- Transforms quotes with random tones (pirate, sarcastic, Shakespeare, etc.)
- Beautiful colored output
- Uses Ollama for LLM transformations
- Modular architecture with LLM interface for easy extensibility

## Architecture

The application is structured with clean, modular components:

```
â”œâ”€â”€ cmd/godayoda/          # Main application entry point
â”œâ”€â”€ internal/
â”‚   â”œâ”€â”€ llm/               # LLM interface and implementations
â”‚   â”‚   â”œâ”€â”€ interface.go   # LLM interface definition
â”‚   â”‚   â””â”€â”€ ollama/        # Ollama implementation
â”‚   â””â”€â”€ quotes/            # Quote fetching and tone management
â””â”€â”€ go.mod
```

- **LLM Interface**: Allows easy swapping between different LLM providers
- **Quotes Module**: Handles quote fetching and tone selection
- **Clean Separation**: Business logic separated from CLI concerns
